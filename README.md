# Overview
This repository contains my solution to the Titanic Machine Learning Kaggle problem, where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features. 

I implemented a basic Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to tackle this classification task, achieving an accuracy of 77.511%.

# Dependencies
I used the following Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
seaborn
matplotlib

# Results
The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 77.511%. The submission file is also available.
